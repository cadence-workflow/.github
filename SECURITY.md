# Security Policy

This is the default security policy for all Cadence repositories. 

## Supported Versions

For each repository, releases can be found in the `<repo>/releases` folder (for example, https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases), with release dates provided. Any version released within the last two years is considered supported.
When a security vulnerability is discovered or reported for a specific version, that version will be marked as unsafe in the corresponding repository.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

If you are viewing this page as the security policy, it means that no version of this repository has been marked as unsafe yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
